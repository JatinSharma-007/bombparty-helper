Never made a chrome extension before, mashed this up in about 30 minutes.
Code is very ugly and I wasn't planning on putting this on GitHub. This is very basic and meant for educational purposes,
please don't ruin anyone's games by abusing it. The game is more fun without mods anyways. :)

# Features

Word-Finder (will suggest 11 matching words to the current letter combination. The first one in the list is the shortest one it found.)
Auto-Joiner (will automatically join when the Join Game button appears, so you don't miss it.)

# Usage Instructions:

This only works on **chrome**.

1. Download and unzip the master source code.
2. Go to chrome://extensions/ and enable developer mode, drag and drop the unzipped folder.
3. Join any bomb party game (on https://jklm.fun/).
4. Enable features you'd like to use by opening the extension's menu.
