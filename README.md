Never made a chrome extension before, mashed this up in about 30 minutes.
Code is very ugly and I wasn't planning on putting this on GitHub. Please only use this to practice and help you learn more words. Any abuse will get you banned by ingame moderators.

# Features

1. Word-Finder (will suggest 11 matching words to the current letter combination. The first one in the list is the shortest one it found.)
2. Auto-Joiner (will automatically join when the Join Game button appears, so you don't miss it.)

# Usage Instructions:

This only works on **chrome**.

1. Download and unzip the master source code.
2. Go to chrome://extensions/ and enable developer mode, drag and drop the unzipped folder.
3. Join any bomb party game (on https://jklm.fun/).
4. Enable features you'd like to use by opening the extension's menu.
